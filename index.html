        <p class="font-bold">What is a batteryless device?</p>

        <p>Batteryless/intermittent devices forgo the batteries used in traditional embedded systems and electronic devices: in their place, energy harvesters (such as solar panels) and capacitors (as energy storage) are used to gather, store, and supply power to the device.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Why batteryless?</p>

        <p>As connected electronic devices continue to proliferate (particularly as part of the ever-growing Internet of Things), maintaining and powering them becomes an increasingly pressing issue.  Batteries tend to be the component with the shortest overall lifespan in an electronic device, and the need to service and replace them places limits in both time and resources on the ability to deploy such devices.  Batteryless computing seeks to not only cut down on the resulting e-waste batteries bring, but also allow for deployment of these devices in situations where physical access is costly or impractical (such as underwater or in space).</p>

        <p>However, forgoing batteries in an electronic device brings an array of unique challenges in both circuit design and programming.  Like <a href=https://crawdad.org/ class="underline">similar projects</a> in the past, this hub seeks to catalogue and collate resources and findings into one location in order to both promote and improve research into batteryless devices.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Contribute</p>

        <p>The Wiki is open to all members of the community to provide research, information and tutorials on components, their properties, and their applications in batteryless and intermittent devices.</p>

        <p>The <a href="./directory/" class="underline">directory</a> contains a curated list of hardware and software artifacts, tools, and data for developing and building batteryless and intermittent devices.  Contact us if you have an artifact for an inclusion in the directory.</p>
